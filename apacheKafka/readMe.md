# Kafka Starter

- Producer And Create Topic
- Consumer 
- Consumer Lag Monitoring





## How it works ?

-  First of all , Zookeeper and Kafka Server must be run locally. (from console)
-  After the Producer application is run, it starts sending messages. (Topic is created within the same application.)
-  Messages can be read from the console after the Consumer application is run.
-  After the ConsumerLag application is run , lag can be monitoring.
-  If you stop the Consumer application, you can see increase in lag
